## 🚀 About Me

I’m a results-oriented **Data Analyst** with a Master’s in Computer Applications and a deep passion for uncovering insights hidden within data.

With strong expertise in **SQL**, **Python (pandas,numpy, matplotlib)**, **Power BI**, and **Excel**, I specialize in building interactive dashboards, performing exploratory data analysis, and creating data-driven solutions to support smarter business decisions.

I believe that **data without insight is just noise** — and my goal is to make it speak clearly.
